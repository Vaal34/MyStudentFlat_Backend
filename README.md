This application project is part of a end-of-year project at **Holberton Actual Digital School** in Toulouse.

### **Are you a student? Looking for an apartment? This application might interest you!**
My Student Flat is an application mainly intended for the student population of Toulouse. It brings together all the affordable apartments (< â‚¬800.00) in the city of Toulouse (31). The goal? To allow all these students to not spend all their time in an intense search for housing.

### **A project, a team**
This application could not exist without the collaboration of two individuals with complementary skills. Amandine Assenat (20 years old) is developing the front-end part, an obvious choice given her background as a graphic designer. Valentin Melia (23 years old) is responsible for creating his own API, which gathers all the apartments in Toulouse. This synergy is the result of this project.

### **Strategically chosen technologies used:**
**Front-end**
- **Flutter (Dart):** The Dart language has advanced features. Flutter has a simple syntax, allowing for the development of an application in two weeks. Flutter has become popular and offers a wide range of resources. It is also suitable for Android and iOS platforms.
**Back-end**
- **Python:** Python is a simple and readable language. It is known for its clear and concise syntax. Python has a large number of libraries for creating APIs, such as Flask, Django, FastAPI, and CherryPy. These libraries facilitate API development and offer many predefined features.
- **MySQL:** MySQL is one of the most popular databases in the world, with a large community of developers and contributors providing abundant documentation and active support.
- **SQLAlchemy:** Enables the connection between web scraping and the database.
- **Flask:** Flask is a library that allows easy customization of an application according to its needs by creating routes.
